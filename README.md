# KanjiFrequencyVisualization

kanji.mp4 is the rendered video using my current corpus. If you want to use your own, check out the notebook.

I've analyzed some books for their number of Kanji occurences and decided to plot them in a histogram and try to fit some distributions. The data I used can be found in my japanese_scripts repository.
